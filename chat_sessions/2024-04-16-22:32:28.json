This process allows the model to better understand and generate text related to that particular domain. There are several ways to finetune an LLM, including using transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point and then further trained on a smaller dataset specific to the task at hand. Another approach is to train the model from scratch on the task-specific dataset. The choice of method will depend on factors such as the size and quality of the available data, the computational resources available, and the desired level of performance.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}]
